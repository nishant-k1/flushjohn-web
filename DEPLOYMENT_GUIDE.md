## 🎯 **How Deployment Works:**

### **Single Command Deploys EVERYTHING:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Optimized site + added landing pages"
git push
```

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ Vercel detects push to Git
2. ✅ Builds Next.js application (src/app/*)
3. ✅ Copies public/ folder files as-is
4. ✅ Deploys both together
5. ✅ Both accessible from same domain

**Result:**
- Next.js pages: https://flushjohn.com/[route]
- HTML pages: https://flushjohn.com/landing/[filename].html

## 🏆 **Best Practices:**

### **For Maximum Leads:**

```

**3. Iterate Based on Data:**
```
Week 1: Test both HTML and Next.js for paid ads
Week 2: Compare conversion rates
Week 3: Send all paid traffic to HTML (if it wins)
Ongoing: A/B test different HTML variations
```

## 💡 **Common Questions:**

### **Q: Will HTML pages affect my SEO?**
**A:** No! They're separate. Use HTML for paid ads only, Next.js for SEO.

### **Q: Can I edit HTML pages without rebuilding Next.js?**
**A:** Yes! Just edit the .html file and `git push`. Instant update.

### **Q: How do I create more HTML landing pages?**
**A:** Copy existing .html file, modify content, save in /public/landing/, push.

### **Q: Can I track conversions separately?**
**A:** Yes! Each HTML page has unique tracking code in the submit function.

### **Q: What if HTML page breaks?**
**A:** It won't affect Next.js site. They're independent. Users can still use main site.
