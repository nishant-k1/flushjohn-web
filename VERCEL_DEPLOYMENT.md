# Vercel Deployment - HTTP/2 Automatic

## ‚úÖ HTTP/2 is Already Enabled!

Your website is deployed on **Vercel**, which **automatically enables HTTP/2 and HTTP/3** for all deployments. No additional configuration is needed.

## What Vercel Provides Automatically

- ‚úÖ **HTTP/2** - Multiplexing, server push, header compression
- ‚úÖ **HTTP/3 (QUIC)** - Even faster, better for mobile networks
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS** - SSL/TLS certificates managed automatically
- ‚úÖ **Edge Network** - Global CDN with 100+ locations
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Optimization** - Image optimization, code splitting, minification

## Verify HTTP/2 is Working

### Method 1: Browser DevTools

1. Open your website (e.g., `https://flushjohn.com`)
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Click on any request
5. Look for **Protocol: h2** (HTTP/2) or **Protocol: http/2+quic** (HTTP/3)

### Method 2: Online Tools

Check if HTTP/2 is enabled using these tools:
- https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test
- https://http2.pro/check  
- https://www.http2check.net/

Enter your domain: `flushjohn.com` (or your actual domain)

### Method 3: Command Line

```bash
curl -I --http2 https://flushjohn.com
```

You should see `HTTP/2 200` in the response headers.

## Why You Might See "Outdated HTTP Protocol" Warning

If you're seeing warnings about outdated HTTP protocol, it could be:

### 1. **Custom Domain Not Configured**
If using the Vercel subdomain (`your-app.vercel.app`), make sure your custom domain is properly configured:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
4. Add your domain
5. Update DNS records as instructed

### 2. **Old Browser/Network**
Some older browsers or corporate firewalls may not support HTTP/2. This is not a Vercel issue.

### 3. **Cached Results**
Clear browser cache and try again.

## Performance Benefits You're Already Getting

With Vercel's automatic HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:

- ‚ö° **20-30% faster** than HTTP/1.1
- üîÑ **Multiplexing**: Multiple requests over single connection
- üì± **Better mobile** performance
- üåç **Global edge network** - content delivered from nearest location
- üöÄ **Automatic optimizations** - images, fonts, code splitting

## Additional Optimizations Available

Vercel also provides (already enabled in your config):

```javascript
// next.config.js
compress: true,                    // Gzip compression
reactStrictMode: true,            // React optimizations
productionBrowserSourceMaps: false, // Smaller bundles
```

## Monitoring Performance

Track your performance metrics:
- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Web Vitals**: Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- **Speed Insights**: Core Web Vitals tracking

## Troubleshooting

### If HTTP/2 shows as "Not Enabled"

1. Check if using HTTPS (required for HTTP/2)
2. Verify domain is properly configured in Vercel
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org/

### Check Vercel Deployment Status

Visit: `https://vercel.com/your-project` and check deployment status.
