# Constants Organization - Feature-Based Structure

## ✅ Migration Complete

All feature-specific constants have been moved to their respective feature folders.

---

## 📊 Summary

### **Moved to Features**
- ✅ `home_data`, `testimonials` → `/features/home/constants/`
- ✅ `products_data` → `/features/products/constants/`
- ✅ `cityPageData` → `/features/locations/constants/`

### **Kept Cross-Cutting** (in `/constants/`)
- ✅ `apiBaseUrls` - API endpoints
- ✅ `phone`, `contact` - Contact information
- ✅ `socialMedia` - Social media links
- ✅ `s3assets`, `websiteURL` - Global URLs
- ✅ `G_TAG_ID` - Analytics

---

## 📂 New Structure

```
/src
  /features
    /home
      /constants
        home.tsx        # home_data, types
        testimonials.ts # testimonials, types
        index.ts        # Barrel export
    
    /products
      /constants
        products.ts     # products_data, types
        index.ts        # Barrel export
    
    /locations
      /constants
        cities.ts       # cityPageData, types
        index.ts        # Barrel export
  
  /constants
    index.tsx          # Cross-cutting constants only
```

## 📝 Import Patterns

### Feature Constants (within feature)
```typescript
// features/home/components/Home.tsx
import { home_data } from "../constants";
```

### Feature Constants (from other features)
```typescript
// components/Footer/index.tsx
import { home_data } from "@/features/home/constants";
```

### Cross-Cutting Constants (from anywhere)
```typescript
import { s3assets, phone, contact } from "@/constants";
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### 1. **Colocation**
- Feature data lives with feature code
- Easy to find and modify

### 2. **Scalability**
- Adding new features is isolated
- No cluttering of main constants file

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Clear ownership of constants
- Easy to understand dependencies

### 4. **Type Safety**
- Feature-specific types exported alongside data
- Better IDE autocomplete

## ✅ Build Status

**Web Project**: ✅ Build Successful
- All 40 routes compiled
- Zero import errors
- All types resolved

## 📌 Type Exports

Each feature barrel export includes:
```typescript
// features/home/constants/index.ts
export { 
  home_data,           // Data
  type HomeData,       // Types
  type Feature,
  type Service,
  type LocationData,
  type HomeImage       // Aliased to avoid conflicts
} from "./home";
```

## 🎉 Result

Your FlushJohn web constants are now perfectly organized by feature, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable!
