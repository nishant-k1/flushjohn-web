# ✅ HTTP/2 Status Check

## Current Status: **HTTP/2 IS ALREADY WORKING**

HTTP/2 is **automatically enabled** on ALL Vercel deployments. No additional setup needed!

---

## 🔍 How to Verify HTTP/2 is Working

### Method 1: Browser DevTools (Easiest)

1. Open your website: `https://flushjohn.com` (or your Vercel URL)
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **Network** tab
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. Click on any request (e.g., documents, CSS, JS files)
6. Look at the headers section
7. Find **Protocol**: `h2` or `http/2`

**What you'll see:**
```
Protocol: h2  ← This means HTTP/2 is working!
```

Or possibly:
```
Protocol: http/2+quic  ← This means HTTP/3 is working!
```

### Method 2: Online Tools

Visit these websites and enter your domain:

1. **HTTP/2 Check**: https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test
   - Enter: `flushjohn.com` (or your domain)
   - Should show: ✅ **HTTP/2: Enabled**

2. **HTTP/2 Pro**: https://http2.pro/check
   - Enter your domain
   - Should show: ✅ **HTTP/2 Enabled**

3. **HTTP/2 Checker**: https://www.http2check.net/
   - Enter your domain
   - Check "HTTP/2 Support"

---

### Method 3: Command Line

Open terminal and run:

```bash
curl -I --http2 https://flushjohn.com
```

**Expected output:**
```
HTTP/2 200
...
```

The `HTTP/2 200` means it's working!

## ❌ If It Says "Disabled"

If any tool says HTTP/2 is disabled, possible causes:

### 1. **Using HTTP instead of HTTPS**
- HTTP/2 only works over HTTPS
- Make sure your domain uses `https://` not `http://`

### 2. **Testing on wrong domain**
- Make sure you're testing the production URL
- Not localhost or dev environment

### 3. **Vercel Project Not Connected**
- Check if project is actually deployed on Vercel
- Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard

## 🚀 What Was Added

The files added (`vercel.json`, etc.) provide:
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, etc.)
- ✅ Configuration documentation
- ❌ **NOT** to enable HTTP/2 (it's already enabled!)

HTTP/2 was already working before these changes!

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

With HTTP/2 enabled, you should see:

- ⚡ 20-30% faster page loads
- 🔄 Multiple requests over single connection
- 📱 Better mobile performance
- 🌍 Global CDN edge network

---

## ✨ Bottom Line

**HTTP/2 is working NOW** on your Vercel deployment!

No action needed. Just verify using the methods above.

---

## Quick Verification

**Fastest way to check:**

1. Open: https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test
2. Enter: `flushjohn.com` (or your actual domain)
3. Click "Check"
4. Should see: ✅ **Enabled**

If it shows ✅ Enabled, you're done! HTTP/2 is working! 🎉
