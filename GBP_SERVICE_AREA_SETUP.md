---

### **Step 5: Verify Your Settings**

After saving, verify that:

- ✅ **"Service-area business"** is enabled
- ✅ **"No customer visits"** is enabled
- ✅ All 25 service areas are listed
- ✅ Your business address (8 The Green STE R, Dover, DE 19901) is still listed (for verification only)

---

## 🎯 **What This Does**

### **Service-Area Business:**
- Tells Google you deliver to customers rather than having them visit you
- Helps Google understand your business model
- Improves local SEO for service-area searches

### **No Customer Visits:**
- Indicates you don't have a physical storefront
- Prevents customers from trying to visit your address
- Ensures Google knows the Dover address is for verification only

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Address Still Required:** Even as a service-area business, you need to keep your Dover, DE address for verification purposes. Google will understand it's not a customer-facing location.

2. **Service Areas vs. Address:** 
   - Your **address** (Dover, DE) = Verification/legal address
   - Your **service areas** = Where you actually serve customers (25 cities)

3. **Visibility:** Once verified and these attributes are set, your business will appear in local searches for all 25 cities you serve.

4. **Can't Find the Options?** 
   - Make sure your business is verified first (some options only appear after verification)
   - Try accessing from desktop browser (mobile app may have limited options)
   - Contact Google Business Profile support if options are missing

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Can't find "Service-area business" option?**

1. **Check if verified:** Some options only appear after verification
2. **Try different section:** Look in "Business information" → "Attributes"
3. **Desktop vs Mobile:** Use desktop browser for full options
4. **Category matters:** Make sure category is "Portable toilet supplier"

### **Can't add service areas?**

1. **Enable service-area business first:** This unlocks the service areas section
2. **Use city, state format:** Type "Houston, TX" not just "Houston"
3. **One at a time:** Add cities individually, not all at once

### **Options grayed out?**

- Your business may need to be verified first
- Some attributes require verification before they can be changed
- Contact Google support if options remain unavailable
