    question: 'What are the porta potty requirements for construction sites?',
    answer:
      'OSHA regulations require construction sites to provide adequate sanitation facilities. Specific requirements: 1 toilet for every 20 workers or fewer, facilities must be available within 200 feet of work areas, hand washing facilities must be provided, toilets must be maintained in sanitary condition with regular cleaning, toilet paper must be provided, and facilities must be available at the start of each workday. For projects lasting more than 30 days, we recommend our construction packages ($150-$200/month) which include weekly servicing. Violations of OSHA sanitation standards can result in significant fines.',

Examples: 1-20 workers = 1 porta potty, 21-40 workers = 2 porta potties, 41-60 workers = 3 porta potties, etc. This is the minimum legal requirement. We often recommend adding extra capacity for convenience and to maintain sanitary conditions between weekly services. For projects with multiple shifts, count the peak worker presence. Always include hand washing stations for OSHA compliance. For sites with 50+ workers, consider adding ADA compliant units even if not legally required.',

Most construction rentals are month-to-month with flexible extension options. There's no maximum rental period - we've supported projects lasting several years. Long-term rentals (3+ months) may qualify for discounted rates. The rental continues until you notify us that the project is complete and schedule pickup. Monthly rentals include weekly servicing.',

For sites with high wind exposure or vandalism concerns, we recommend additional securing methods. Units can also be locked after hours if needed.

    answer:
      'Porta potties should be placed on relatively level, firm ground. Minor unevenness (1-2 inches) can usually be accommodated with leveling boards or pads. For significantly uneven terrain, we may need to use wooden platforms or leveling systems. Soft ground (mud, sand, loose dirt) can cause units to sink or become unstable. Solutions for soft ground: place plywood sheets under units for distribution of weight, use ground protection mats, wait for ground to dry if possible, or select alternate placement location. For construction sites with poor ground conditions, discuss terrain challenges when booking so we can plan appropriate solutions.',

General guidelines: For events under 4 hours without alcohol: 1 unit per 50 people. For events under 4 hours with alcohol: 1 unit per 35-40 people.

We recommend deluxe or luxury units for weddings rather than standard units. It's better to have extra capacity than too few units. Consider separate units for ceremony vs. reception if locations are far apart. Plan for women's higher usage (60-70% of restroom usage typically). Include 1 ADA unit for accessibility.',
