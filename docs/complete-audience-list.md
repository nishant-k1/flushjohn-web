## 🎯 Audience Naming Convention

Use consistent naming:

- `Quote Page Visitors`
- `Contact Page Visitors`
- `Products Page Visitors`
- `City Pages Visitors` (all cities)
- `Blog Visitors` (all blog pages)
- `Homepage Visitors`
- `FAQ Page Visitors`
- `About Page Visitors`

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Use "URL Contains" for Multiple Pages

Instead of creating separate audiences for each city:
- Create one: "City Pages Visitors"
- Use: URL contains `/cities/` or `/city/`
- This captures all city pages in one audience

### 2. Exclude Converters (Advanced)

Once you have converters:
- Create "Quote Page Visitors (Non-Converters)"
- Include: URL contains `/quote`
- Exclude: People who converted

### 3. Combine Audiences (Advanced)

Create high-intent combinations:
- "Visited Quote OR Contact Page"
- "Visited Products AND City Page"
- "Blog Visitors who also visited Quote Page"
