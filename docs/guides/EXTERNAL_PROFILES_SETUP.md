## Overview

Creating profiles on BBB, Yelp, and Google Business Profile addresses the audit's "lack of external validation" concern and builds trust signals.

**⚠️ Important Constraint:** If you're operating from India, Google Business Profile creation may be restricted. See workarounds below.

## Priority Order

### 1. Google Business Profile (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ⭐⭐⭐

**Why:** Most important for local SEO and customer discovery

**⚠️ Location Constraint:**

- Google may restrict GBP creation from outside the US
- You may need a US-based person or service to create it
- Alternative: Focus on Yelp and BBB first (they're less restrictive)

**Workarounds (if you want to pursue GBP):**

**Option A: Use a US-based Service**

- Hire a virtual assistant or service in the US to create the profile
- Services like Fiverr/Upwork have GBP setup specialists ($50-150)
- They can create it using your business information
- You'll still need mail forwarding for verification postcard

**Option B: Wait Until You Have US Presence**

- If you plan to visit the US or have a US-based partner
- Create GBP during that time
- Or wait until you have a US-based team member

**Option C: Focus on Other Platforms First**

- Yelp and BBB are easier to set up from anywhere
- Build trust there first
- Add GBP later when feasible

**If You Can Create It:**

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Create account with business email
3. Add business name: "FlushJohn"
4. Add address: "8 The Green STE R, Dover, DE 19901"
5. **Select "I deliver goods and services to my customers"** (Service-Area Business)
6. Add service areas: All 25+ cities across 6 states
7. Add business category: "Portable Toilet Rental Service"
8. Add phone: (877) 790-7062
9. Add website: https://www.flushjohn.com
10. Add business hours (if applicable)
11. Upload business photos (logo, porta potty units, trucks)
12. Request verification postcard

**Verification:**

- Google will mail a postcard to your Dover address
- Use mail forwarding service: iPostal1, Anytime Mailbox, or EarthClassMail ($10-30/month)
- Enter verification code when received
- Once verified, your profile goes live

**After Setup:**

- Add posts regularly (service updates, tips)
- Respond to any reviews immediately
- Update hours if they change
- Add photos of recent deliveries (with permission)

**Cost:** FREE (or $50-150 if using a service to create it)
