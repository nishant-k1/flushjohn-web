## ⏰ **Time Zone Considerations**

### **Business Hours**

Your GBP hours are set to **08:00-20:00** (US Eastern Time).

**When managing from India:**

- **India Time (IST):** UTC+5:30
- **US Eastern Time (EST):** UTC-5 (or UTC-4 during DST)
- **Difference:** ~10.5 hours (India is ahead)

**Example:**

- When it's 08:00 EST in US = 18:30 IST in India
- When it's 20:00 EST in US = 06:30 IST next day in India

**Recommendation:**

- Keep hours as 08:00-20:00 EST (matches your US service)
- This is correct for your US customers
- Your location doesn't change this
